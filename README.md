## Setup
Things you'll need:

- A command line capabale of running Git and NodeJS
- Git
- NodeJS
- A PostgreSQL database

Setting up the server:

1. Type 'git clone <>' in the desired directory of the files (this will create a folder called 'blog' containing everything in the repo).
2. Type 'npm install' in the 'blog' folder, this will install the various dependancies required by the project.
3. Add environment variables for the following: <>
4. Type 'node server', if all is well, the server should then launch successfully onto localhost:8000 (by default, this can be changed by altering the <> variables).
5. Congrats! Everything should now be working!

1. Back then soldiers didn't have as much technology as we do nowadays, so they just didn't have many connections to the outside world. The majority of what they'd hear was from military officials, and even that was unreliable at times.
2. I think that it unmotivated and bored the soldiers. However given today's technology, the soldiers would have more recreational activities to participate in at the camps. This would be a lot easier on them rather than waiting around nervously until something happens.
3. I think Crane opened with that to assist the reader in understanding just how little the soldiers knew about the conflict they were actively fighting. It could also double as a plot device to help clue the reader in on what the conflict was about, as the other soldiers briefly went over this throughout chapter one
4. I believe it is as it can help set the theme/mood of the book, and can help the reader feel empathy for the soldiers as they wait in the camps in uncertainty. As said previously, this could have been a plot device as well to help the reader understand the story of the upcoming conflicts.
5. The first couple paragraphs go over the weather, as it states that winter was ending and spring was beginning. Then it moved on immediately to the soldiers exchanging rumors (to show how little the soldiers knew). Later in the book begins to imply that the rumors were, in fact, just rumors seeing as how they had been through to many other people already, and the second paragraph ending with a soldier moving in to spread the rumor to the rest of his fellow soldiers. I think the theme of this book will be a bit suspenseful as the hostile camp fires could be seen out in the distant fields, showing the enemy is close to their camp.

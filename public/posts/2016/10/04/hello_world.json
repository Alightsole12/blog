	"content":"<p>So today marks the day in which I make my <i>first</i> blog post! Everything has been built from the ground up aside from a grid system I borrowed from <a href='http://www.getbootstrap.com'>Bootstrap</a> and the use of popular Node.js packages. Everything is open source of this Github <a href='#'>repo</a> and is being hosted thanks to Heroku (possibly the only good and free way to host a Node.js app, by the way).<br/><br/>Currently everything is running on MEAN stack due to my recent obsession with the NPM community, although I'm heavily considering sticking to a more familiar SQL database rather than the MEAN standard of Mongo. since the only type of DB Heroku currently offers is a PostgreSQL one (and I'd rather use Heroku's since it's easier to manage). Perhaps one day when I start making more money on web development I'll invest in a server of my own so I don't have to keep jumping hosts whenever I want to make something new. I plan on hosting my various other express projects on here as well, while keeping this stuff in the /blog/ section.<br/><br/>I plan on posting here once every so often, most likely on every other week due to how busy I am with school and stuff. I have more ideas of things to add to the blog, including: </p><ul><li>Email notifications (for when I <i>do</i> post)</li><li>Disqus Comments</li><li>Sharing to social media</li><li>Possibly a patreon, although I don't know how I feel about taking donations for shitposting all day</li></ul><p>As usual, I'll be active on my <a href='http://www.twitter.com/TaizWeb'>Twitter</a>, and I'll be tweeting out development updates on there.</p>"
